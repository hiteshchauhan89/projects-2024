Create an EFS and connect it to 3 different EC2 instances. Make sure that all instances have different operating systems. For instance, Ubuntu, Red Hat Linux and Amazon Linux 2.

1. First we need to create the EC2 Instance Ubuntu

2. After Creating the instance we need to take access to the instance from a public ip.

3. After connect the public IP we need to update the Ubuntu so this is the command
sudo apt-get update
4. After Update the ec2 instance we need to install the nfs-common package this package helps to efs connection so we need to run this command for the nfs-common package install

sudo apt-get -y install nfs-common
5. After installing the package we need to create a directory of efs.
sudo mkdir efs

6.df -h 
This Command helps you to will display information about all the mounted file systems which will include total size, used space, usage percentage, and the mount point
7.Then We used the command of efs
mount -t nfs4 -o krb5p <DNS_NAME>:/ /efs/
